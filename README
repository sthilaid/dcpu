I'm trying to put togheter a dcpu emulator for the fun of learning Go
and the dcpu architecture. This processor was invented by Markus
"notch" Persson when working on his 2nd game for Mojan, 0x10c

The details of the architecture: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

TODO list:

- implement tests and benchmarks to validate the implementation a bit
- implement a "debugger" to help see if things seems okay or not...
- implement a mnemonic to assembly parser
- implement a real 100 mHz implmentation (now not capped in speed) to
  conform processor spec
- implement some unit tests for the dcpu package
- write a compiler that has a backend to dcpu (or use an existing one,
  and just modify the backend)
- ...
- ...
- rule the galaxy :)

Cheers!
