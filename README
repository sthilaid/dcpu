I'm trying to put togheter a dcpu emulator for the fun of learning Go
and the dcpu architecture. This processor was invented by Markus
"notch" Persson when working on his 2nd game for Mojan, 0x10c

The details of the architecture: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

TODO list:

- implement a "debugger" to help see if things seems okay or not...
- implement some unit tests for the dcpu package write a compiler that
- has a backend to dcpu (or use an existing one, and just modify the
- backend)
- ...
- ...
- rule the galaxy :)

Cheers!
